# Scortched Earth in PYGAME

## Introduction

This is an in-progress reproduction of the classic game Scortched-Earth made in python.
The version implemented here is a simpler version similar to the complexity of the game Gorillas.

The objective of this recreation is purely for learning and entertainment purposes.

## Gameplay

At each turn, one of the two players may move around until their energy is depleted.
Once that happens, the player is no longer allowed to move and may throw their banana
to try to hit the other player. After the banana lands, it's the other players turn.

The game ends once all three of the player's lives is taken.
